The refractive index of a material can be determined indirectly from measurements of the *minimum deviation angle* of a ray through the material (when the material is made into a prism).  




The mimimum deviation angle occurs when the internal reflections form a (low energy?) symmetrical arrangement.

When the inner ray is parallel with the base of the prism the system undergoes a unique state of
symmetry and the internal reflections merge with the transmitted ray.

This mathematica program was made to help me and my lab partner understand this phenomenon.
